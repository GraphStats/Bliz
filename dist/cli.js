Specifically the "${s}" package is present but this platform
needs the "${i}" package instead. People often get into this
situation by installing esbuild on Windows or macOS and copying "node_modules"
into a Docker image that runs Linux, or by copying "node_modules" between
Windows and WSL environments.

If you are installing with npm, you can try not copying the "node_modules"
directory when you copy the files over, and running "npm ci" or "npm install"
on the destination platform after the copy. Or you could consider using yarn
instead of npm which has built-in support for installing a package on multiple
platforms simultaneously.

If you are installing with yarn, you can try listing both this platform and the
other platform in your ".yarnrc.yml" file using the "supportedArchitectures"
feature: https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc/#supportedArchitectures
Keep in mind that this means multiple copies of esbuild will be present.

Specifically the "${s}" package is present but this platform
needs the "${i}" package instead. People often get into this
situation by installing esbuild with npm running inside of Rosetta 2 and then
trying to use it with node running outside of Rosetta 2, or vice versa (Rosetta
2 is Apple's on-the-fly x86_64-to-arm64 translation service).

If you are installing with npm, you can try ensuring that both npm and node are
not running under Rosetta 2 and then reinstalling esbuild. This likely involves
changing how you installed npm and/or node. For example, installing node with
the universal installer here should work: https://nodejs.org/en/download/. Or
you could consider using yarn instead of npm which has built-in support for
installing a package on multiple platforms simultaneously.

If you are installing with yarn, you can try listing both "arm64" and "x64"
in your ".yarnrc.yml" file using the "supportedArchitectures" feature:

More information: The file containing the code for esbuild's JavaScript API (${__filename}) does not appear to be inside the esbuild package on the file system, which usually means that the esbuild package was bundled into another file. This is problematic because the API needs to run a binary executable inside the esbuild package which is located using a relative path from the API code to the executable. If the esbuild package is bundled, the relative path will be incorrect and the executable won't be found.`);{let{binPath:i,isWASM:e}=xg();return e?["node",[i]]:[i,[]]}},ht=()=>bg.isatty(2),yg={readFile(i,e){try{let t=vi.readFileSync(i,"utf8");try{vi.unlinkSync(i)}catch{}e(null,t)}catch(t){e(t,null)}},writeFile(i,e){try{let t=Kp();vi.writeFileSync(t,i),e(t)}catch{e(null)}}},wg={readFile(i,e){try{vi.readFile(i,"utf8",(t,n)=>{try{vi.unlink(i,()=>e(t,n))}catch{e(t,n)}})}catch(t){e(t,null)}},writeFile(i,e){try{let t=Kp();vi.writeFile(t,i,n=>e(n!==null?null:t))}catch{e(null)}}},_g="0.21.5",Eg=i=>bi().build(i),Sg=i=>bi().context(i),kg=(i,e)=>bi().transform(i,e),Rg=(i,e)=>bi().formatMessages(i,e),Ag=(i,e)=>bi().analyzeMetafile(i,e),Tg=i=>{if(_e&&!vt)return Ee||(Ee=yn(_e)),Ee.buildSync(i);let e;return bn(t=>t.buildOrContext({callName:"buildSync",refs:null,options:i,isTTY:ht(),defaultWD:gi,callback:(n,a)=>{if(n)throw n;e=a}})),e},Cg=(i,e)=>{if(_e&&!vt)return Ee||(Ee=yn(_e)),Ee.transformSync(i,e);let t;return bn(n=>n.transform({callName:"transformSync",refs:null,input:i,options:e||{},isTTY:ht(),fs:yg,callback:(a,s)=>{if(a)throw a;t=s}})),t},Og=(i,e)=>{if(_e&&!vt)return Ee||(Ee=yn(_e)),Ee.formatMessagesSync(i,e);let t;return bn(n=>n.formatMessages({callName:"formatMessagesSync",refs:null,messages:i,options:e,callback:(a,s)=>{if(a)throw a;t=s}})),t},Pg=(i,e)=>{if(_e&&!vt)return Ee||(Ee=yn(_e)),Ee.analyzeMetafileSync(i,e);let t;return bn(n=>n.analyzeMetafile({callName:"analyzeMetafileSync",refs:null,metafile:typeof i=="string"?i:JSON.stringify(i),options:e,callback:(a,s)=>{if(a)throw a;t=s}})),t},jg=()=>(vn&&vn(),Ee&&Ee.stop(),Promise.resolve()),os=!1,Lg=i=>{if(i=sg(i||{}),i.wasmURL)throw new Error('The "wasmURL" option only works in the browser');if(i.wasmModule)throw new Error('The "wasmModule" option only works in the browser');if(i.worker)throw new Error('The "worker" option only works in the browser');if(os)throw new Error('Cannot call "initialize" more than once');return bi(),os=!0,Promise.resolve()},gi=process.cwd(),mt,vn,bi=()=>{if(mt)return mt;let[i,e]=Vp(),t=Gp.spawn(i,e.concat("--service=0.21.5","--ping"),{windowsHide:!0,stdio:["pipe","pipe","inherit"],cwd:gi}),{readFromStdout:n,afterClose:a,service:s}=Up({writeToStdin(l){t.stdin.write(l,u=>{u&&a(u)})},readFileSync:vi.readFileSync,isSync:!1,hasFS:!0,esbuild:xt});t.stdin.on("error",a),t.on("error",a);let r=t.stdin,o=t.stdout;o.on("data",n),o.on("end",a),vn=()=>{r.destroy(),o.destroy(),t.kill(),os=!1,mt=void 0,vn=void 0};let c=0;t.unref(),r.unref&&r.unref(),o.unref&&o.unref();let p={ref(){++c===1&&t.ref()},unref(){--c===0&&t.unref()}};return mt={build:l=>new Promise((u,d)=>{s.buildOrContext({callName:"build",refs:p,options:l,isTTY:ht(),defaultWD:gi,callback:(h,v)=>h?d(h):u(v)})}),context:l=>new Promise((u,d)=>s.buildOrContext({callName:"context",refs:p,options:l,isTTY:ht(),defaultWD:gi,callback:(h,v)=>h?d(h):u(v)})),transform:(l,u)=>new Promise((d,h)=>s.transform({callName:"transform",refs:p,input:l,options:u||{},isTTY:ht(),fs:wg,callback:(v,g)=>v?h(v):d(g)})),formatMessages:(l,u)=>new Promise((d,h)=>s.formatMessages({callName:"formatMessages",refs:p,messages:l,options:u,callback:(v,g)=>v?h(v):d(g)})),analyzeMetafile:(l,u)=>new Promise((d,h)=>s.analyzeMetafile({callName:"analyzeMetafile",refs:p,metafile:typeof l=="string"?l:JSON.stringify(l),options:u,callback:(v,g)=>v?h(v):d(g)}))},mt},bn=i=>{let[e,t]=Vp(),n=new Uint8Array,{readFromStdout:a,afterClose:s,service:r}=Up({writeToStdin(c){if(n.length!==0)throw new Error("Must run at most one command");n=c},isSync:!0,hasFS:!0,esbuild:xt});i(r);let o=Gp.execFileSync(e,t.concat("--service=0.21.5"),{cwd:gi,windowsHide:!0,input:n,maxBuffer:+process.env.ESBUILD_MAX_BUFFER||16*1024*1024});a(o),s(null)},Kp=()=>rs.join(gg.tmpdir(),`esbuild-${vg.randomBytes(32).toString("hex")}`),Ee=null,yn=i=>{let{port1:e,port2:t}=new i.MessageChannel,n=new i.Worker(__filename,{workerData:{workerPort:t,defaultWD:gi,esbuildVersion:"0.21.5"},transferList:[t],execArgv:[]}),a=0,s=p=>{let l=new Error(`Build failed with 1 error:
